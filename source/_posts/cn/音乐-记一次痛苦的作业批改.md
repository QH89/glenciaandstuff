	先不说钢琴。和声和旋律都有很大问题。

1. 量化问题：调量化的时候只选择和弦就行了。我好像把旋律也量化了。 
   解决方法：把右上角“门”形状的东西打开。
2. 旋律问题：抢拍没有抢上。旋律...我再改吧...参考起承转合那个视频。
3. 和弦问题：四级小是一个属和弦，不能接五级和弦。
4. 钢琴织体：双手思维（左手和右手分开设计）先找左手的律动、调音高。然后写右手分解+柱式

我完美地示范了什么叫不学无术、闭门造车（仰头）

旋律作曲重新学习：

1. 起承转合作曲法：五声音阶动机+模进+更改律动、加入离调或者比较有紧张感的音符+落在125，节奏和动机类似
2. 把握旋律起伏：上行、下行、平行；级进、跳进
   主歌一般级进多一些，级进流动感比较好。级进+上行/下行=积攒情绪；副歌可以用八度跳进

旋律作曲课：
1. 歌曲要回答三个问题：谁在说话、对谁说话、为什么说。
If I know better, I wouldn't let the phantom take control. 
What's hidden shall be revealed. And every construction you made never
covers the truth. 
Lying is just a wild goose chase. For I hate the desperate and dismal in your eyes. 
Why can't I know better, than what is told and what is shown. 
我想这首歌的主题就是——我想我是时候好好学习了。
这首歌的情境就是我回初中的路上遇到王艺，然后跟她讲我最近遇到的诸多不顺的事。
这首歌最好不要太欢快，最好跟喝大了一样摇摇摆摆的。
2. 多去听别人的谈话。你挖掘到的每个点都能成为一首歌的中心。 
   第三人称叙述：全知全能，说什么时间，什么人的心理都行 vs 第一人称叙述：和观众的联系更紧密
   我希望我写的歌是把听众当成一个曾经很熟悉，但是现在没有那么熟悉的朋友。或者喝大了遇到的酒友也行。
   My friend, don't take me wrong. I'm drunk and speaking nonse.
   Yesterday, I dreamed about my friends. How I met them and get rid of them.
   Honesetly, I don't believe, that any of them really understand me. 
   But still, at least, I'm not gonna lie to myself, not like them.
   
   Someday we all got to hail to god, 
   so at least don't accuse me for not kneeling when you felt wrong.
   These webs you create with your words tangle me when I was stupid and young.
   If there's way to prevent it from killing me now. 
   
   When you are young, you live inside a box
   and take what ever people feed you
   I ain't complaining, I ain't asscusing
   I'm just saying, speak for yourself, don't you dare speak for truth and god
   
   don't let your heart disturb you, 
   don't let your theories became weapon
   don't let it be, don't take it slow
   just speak for your feeling now, just see who you really are
   
   if you see what I see, feel what I feel
   you'd know how heavy it is to carry my burden
   It's always an uneasiness to live in pure stupidness.
   
   Be true, be honeset, thought it's never easy.
   It takes patience, takes courage, takes wisdom.
   Too bad I only want to take the short cut didn't see what's coming next
   Now I know what to do.
   I seek for nothing but what's true.
   What's shining in my destiny, and probably yours too.

3. journey of song:
past, now, future, engine for developing ideas.
try one myself: 
I used to take what ever people say, even I find it untrue. I'd defend for them.

Now I find I'm nothing but consciousness. I see how much burden I carry for my stupidness and pride, so I put them down.

Someday I'd be a true true man, someday I'd speak for nothing but myself.
When you're young you're under much limitation.
When you're older, what you are doesn't change, but somehow it looks different. 

So my song is about truth, and truth misplaced. 
yeah, it's my red sea of solaris
what a poetic irony
4. 你在创作的时候会有很多新想法——太真实了
5. 六个最好的朋友：who what when where why how
   who: my dear friend and a stranger misplaced
   what: 
   when: it's winter, but almost spring
   where: stair case, where I'd like to stay, some place no one knows
6. verse: deliver the basic information of your song
   chorus: easy to sing and remember; states the central ideas of the song; move to a different level (from facts to feelings perhaps) and summarize and/or comment on the information provided in the verse
   bridge: connect sections; also move to a different level of information than other sections
   要不把pre-chorus 删了吧
7. bernice 的故事: chorus 应当比先前的段落更突出，而且最好不在之前出现

旋律作曲第二课
1. rule of prosody: all elements work together to support the central message of the song
   亚里士多德在他的诗学里提出所有伟大的作品都有一致性（unity）
   stable vs unstable
   which art is all about. Making choices. Making choices for a reason. Then you don't only depend on things just  come out intuitively, althought it's great
